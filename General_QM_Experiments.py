"""
CQED creates a quantum machine with the OPX and Octave that 
allows you to run experiments on a specified number of qubits and
resonators.

Each qubit/resonator passed in has the following properties:
* A drive frequency
* A name

So, we submit a dictionary with the following properties:

elements = {
    "name of qubit 1" : drive frequency as a double, ex: 7.65456e9
    "name of resonator 1" : drive frequency as a double, ex: ...
    etc
}

Now, this orients the octave and OPX towards creating these elements,
and we can add waveforms/pulses/operations that allow us to do more complex
operations.

Notably, all elements are mixInputs, ie, we are always using IQ upconverting mixing 
to create pulses we can use. 

Generally, it is best practice to create elements via initialization, add
waveforms (both digital and analog) and integration weights that will be used, 
create pulses, and add these pulses as operations to associated elements. An 
example is commented at the bottom of this file. 

Important to note that we do not change the correction matrix in the mixers. We do,
however, change the LO and IF frequencies

    We pass in a desired Intermediate frequency IF, this can also just be a float.
